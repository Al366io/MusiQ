<h1 align="center"> MusiQ </h1>

MusiQ is an app that lets an host create a party connecting his spotify account (or other services)

Guests are then able to add to this queue through a scanned QR code or invite link.

This app is set to solve DJ-ing issues of house parties.

## Features

### Owner

The owner can create a room/party of which he can set the rules.
There are quite a few rules. We might decrease or increase them based on demands.

#### Visibility of the Queue

This options defines whether or not users can see the current queue.
Is it is turned on, users will see the queue that is currently up.
Otherwise, they will add musics to the queue without seeing it.
That can be interesting for blind tests or surprising experiences or games (like guessing who put the music)

#### Upvote / Downvote

This option defines whether or not upvotes and downvotes are enabled.
Upvotes and downvotes change the place of the song in the queue. With an upvote, this song will jump over the preceding song and the other way around.

#### Genre Respect

With this option, the owner can make sure that music that are added to the queue respect a certain genre or collection of genre.
You don't want Miley Cyrus ruining your rock'n'roll evening, do you?

#### Timeout

This options decides on the minimum time between duplicate songs.
If it is set to 60 minute, songs will not be playing twice within that timeframe

#### Member-only

This options decides whether or not users need to be logged in to join the room
