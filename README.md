## Features

### Owner

The owner can create a room/party of which he can set the rules.
There are quite a few rules. We might decrease or increase them based on demands.

#### Visibility of the Queue

This options defines whether or not users can see the current queue.
Is it is turned on, users will see the queue that is currently up.
Otherwise, they will add musics to the queue without seeing it.
That can be interesting for blind tests or surprising experiences or games (like guessing who put the music).

#### Upvote / Downvote

This option defines whether or not upvotes and downvotes are enabled.
Upvotes and downvotes change the place of the song in the queue. With an upvote, this song will jump over the preceding song and the other way around.

#### Genre Respect

With this option, the owner can make sure that music that are added to the queue respect a certain genre or collection of genre.
You don't want Miley Cyrus ruining your rock'n'roll evening, do you?

#### Timeout

This options decides on the minimum time between duplicate songs.
If it is set to 60 minute, songs will not be playing twice within that timeframe.

#### Member-only

This options decides whether or not users need to be logged in to join the room.


### Adders

Adders, after scanning the QR code or following the invite link will be sent to a landing page where they can login or just join as guest.
Once joining, they will be sent to the page where the current playing song is displayed with, under it, the queue.

The adding button shows a research bar to search for a song to add.
All songs have their album cover, name, genre and minutes remaining displayed.

If activated, they can also upvote and downvote songs to make their position change within the queue.
Those votes are limited to one per person and per song not to have any abuse related to it.

##### We hope you enjoy MusiQ as much as we enjoyed creating it
